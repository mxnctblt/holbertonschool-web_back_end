# MySQL advanced

## Learning Objectives

- How to create tables with constraints
- How to optimize queries by adding indexes
- What is and how to implement stored procedures and functions in MySQL
- What is and how to implement views in MySQL
- What is and how to implement triggers in MySQL

## Tasks

### Task 0. We are all unique!

Write a SQL script that creates a table users following these requirements:

- With these attributes:
  - id, integer, never null, auto increment and primary key
  - email, string (255 characters), never null and unique
  - name, string (255 characters)
- If the table already exists, your script should not fail
- Your script can be executed on any database

Context: Make an attribute unique directly in the table schema will enforced your business rules and avoid bugs in your application

### Task 1. In and not out

Write a SQL script that creates a table users following these requirements:

- With these attributes:
  - id, integer, never null, auto increment and primary key
  - email, string (255 characters), never null and unique
  - name, string (255 characters)
  - country, enumeration of countries: US, CO and TN, never null (= default will be the first element of the enumeration, here US)
- If the table already exists, your script should not fail
- Your script can be executed on any database

### Task 2. Best band ever!

Write a SQL script that ranks country origins of bands, ordered by the number of (non-unique) fans

Requirements:

- Import this table dump: metal_bands.sql.zip
- Column names must be: origin and nb_fans
- Your script can be executed on any database

### Task 3. Old school band

Write a SQL script that lists all bands with Glam rock as their main style, ranked by their longevity

Requirements:

- Import this table dump: metal_bands.sql.zip
- Column names must be: band_name and lifespan (in years)
- You should use attributes formed and split for computing the lifespan
- Your script can be executed on any database

### Task 4. Buy buy buy

Write a SQL script that creates a trigger that decreases the quantity of an item after adding a new order.

Quantity in the table items can be negative.

Context: Updating multiple tables for one action from your application can generate issue: network disconnection, crash, etcâ€¦ to keep your data in a good shape, let MySQL do it for you!
